Predicting Robbery Patterns in Los Angeles
The goal of this project is to build a model that can help predict the patterns and trends of robbery in Los Angeles. We will use data from the most recent years in crime to use certain characteristics like neighborhood and incident details to determine type of robbery that may occur.
